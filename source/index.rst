Overview
========
OrgMiner: tookit for Process Mining on the organizational perspective

Process mining is an emerging discipline that bridges the gap between 
traditional process science (e.g., simulation-based business process 
analysis) and the rapidly-growing data science research (e.g., machine 
learning on big data), which offers a comprehensive set of tools to 
provide fact-based insights supporting business process improvement 
[vdaalst2016process]_. 

The current release of OrgMiner is based on our recent research progress 
reported in a preprint paper submitted to the journal of Information 
Systems. The library includes all the necessary modules and functions to 
implement the approach proposed in the paper and thus enables 
replicating the designed experiments for evaluation.
