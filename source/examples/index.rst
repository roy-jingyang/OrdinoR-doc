This page provides a list of example applications built upon OrgMiner. 
See the index below.

Several examples related to the organizational model mining framework 
[yang2020]_:

* :ref:`Discover organizational models from event logs and evaluate using 
  conformance checking <examples_jis2020yang-common>`
* :ref:`Discover an organizational model from an event log and visualize the 
  model <examples_jis2020yang-arya>` (cf. Sect. 5.2 in the paper)
* :ref:`Replicate the experiments in the framework paper 
  <examples_jis2020yang-common_replicate>` (cf. Sect. 6.2, footnote 8 in 
  the paper)

Access to demos for some of our previous work on the topic is also 
available, which were then built upon the earlier versions of OrgMiner:

* :ref:`examples_caise2020ouyang` (demo in [ouyang2020]_)
* :ref:`examples_bpm2018yang` (demo in [yang2018]_)
