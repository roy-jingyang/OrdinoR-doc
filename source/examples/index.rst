This page provides a list of example applications built upon OrgMiner. 
See the index below.

Several examples related to the organizational model mining framework 
[yang2020]_:

* :ref:`Discover organizational models from event logs and evaluate using 
  conformance checking <examples_infsyst2020yang-common>`
* :ref:`Discover an organizational model from an event log and visualize 
  the model <examples_infsyst2020yang-arya>` (cf. Sect. 5.2 in the paper)
* :ref:`Replicate the experiments in the framework paper 
  <examples_infsyst2020yang-replicate>` (cf. Sect. 6.2 in the paper)

Access to demos for some of our previous work on the topic is also 
available, which were then built upon the earlier versions of OrgMiner:

* :ref:`examples_bpm2018yang` (demo in [yang2018]_)
