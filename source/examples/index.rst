This page provides a list of example applications built upon OrgMiner. 
See the index below.

Examples related to the organizational model mining framework [yang2020]_:

* Discover organizational models from event logs and evaluate using 
  conformance checking
* Discover an organizational model from an event log and visualize the 
  model (cf. Sect. 5.2 in the paper)
* Replicate the experiments in the framework paper (cf. Sect. 6.2, 
  footnote 8 in the paper)

Access to demos for some of our previous work on the topic is also 
available, which were then built upon the earlier versions of OrgMiner:

* :ref:`examples_caise2020ouyang` (demo in [ouyang2020]_)
* :ref:`examples_bpm2018yang` (demo in [yang2018]_)
